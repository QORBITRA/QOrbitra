# QOrbitra

**Version:** v0.1 — Research Framework  
**Status:** Active Development | Foundational Quantum Logic Study (0² + 1²)

## Overview

QOrbitra is an independent quantum-logic research initiative exploring mathematical normalization of quantum states for decentralized infrastructure.  
Our current phase focuses on two-state normalization logic (`0² + 1² = 1`), aiming to reduce noise and improve state fidelity within quantum computation models — serving as a bridge between classical and quantum paradigms.

This repository contains all foundational materials: mathematical frameworks, simulations, blockchain integration notes, and cryptographic experiments.

## Research Focus

### Hypothesis
> The normalization layer expressed as `0² + 1²` can stabilize qubit amplitude and preserve information integrity under noisy environments, forming a logical basis for post-quantum cryptography and computation.

**Core Research Objectives:**
- Model the normalization layer within Hilbert-space mathematics.  
- Simulate fidelity retention under depolarizing and phase-damping noise models (via IBM Qiskit).  
- Compare classical vs quantum amplitude stability.  
- Prepare formal reports for IBM Quantum Lab verification.  

**Why this matters:**  
If successful, this approach could form the mathematical foundation for next-generation decentralized systems — where blockchain, AI, and quantum computing converge.

## Quickstart

### Local / Colab Simulation

**Requirements**
```bash
pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib pandas

Run Example

git clone https://github.com/QORBITRA/QOrbitra.git
cd QOrbitra/simulation
python baseline_run.py --shots 1024 --noise p=0.02

Output:
results/fidelity_plot.png, results/fidelity_data.json

To run on IBM Quantum:

1. Set your IBMQ API token in ~/.qiskit/qiskitrc


2. Run:



python run_ibm_job.py --backend ibmq_qasm_simulator




IBM Validation Plan

Objective: Validate amplitude stability from the normalization layer (0² + 1²).

Procedure:

Compare noise simulation vs IBM real hardware.

Measure fidelity, trace distance, and error-rate delta.


Expected Output:

ibm_submission.ipynb

ibm_report_v0_1.pdf
